This project is a continuation of this project here:
https://repl.it/I2XB/73
...but should incoorporate more tests since Learn.co hasn't covered
testing very well up to this point.

This project will contain four classes:
  1.) Pilots (listed by callsigns)
  2.) Aircraft Maintenance Officers (AMO's) 
  3.) Airframes
  4.) Squadron
  
The instances of pilots will have to know what airframe they're assigned to
The AMO's have to do the same
The Airframe instances whould track pilot & AMO assigned.
The Squadron will import a CSV list of data showing pilots, airframes, and push the correct data to the correct class
